A [force-directed graph](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) using images as nodes, with accompanying text labels. Upgraded to the D3 4.0 API in response to the post on the D3 mailing list [Force Directed Graph Node Labels in V4](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/d3-js/dfsH9n7qvPA). Draws from this 4.0 example [Force Dragging III](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048). The only thing missing from the original is the dragging.
